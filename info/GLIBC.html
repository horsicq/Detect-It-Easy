Overview

Any Unix-like operating system needs a C library: the library which defines the ``system calls'' 
and other basic facilities such as open, malloc, printf, exit...

The GNU C Library is used as the C library in the GNU systems and most systems with the Linux kernel.

Project Goals

The GNU C Library is primarily designed to be a portable and high performance C library. It follows all 
relevant standards including ISO C11 and POSIX.1-2008. It is also internationalized and has one of the 
most complete internationalization interfaces known.
