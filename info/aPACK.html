Copyright © 1997-2012 Jørgen Ibsen. All Rights Reserved.

aPACK is a compressor for 16-bit DOS executables -- it can compress .exe and .com programs while keeping them executable.

Most DOS executable compressors use a standard depacker for every file, however parts of the depacker are not required or can be optimized for certain executables. aPACK produces a specifically optimized depacker for every executable it compresses.

aPACK has ranked as one of the best 16-bit DOS executable compressors for years.

aPACK is free to use even for commercial use, please check the included license for details.
