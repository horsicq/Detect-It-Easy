PDB stands for Program Database, a proprietary file format (developed by Microsoft) 
for storing debugging information about a program (or, commonly, program modules such as a 
DLL or EXE). PDB files commonly have a .pdb extension. A PDB file is typically created from 
source files during compilation. It stores a list of all symbols in a module with their 
addresses and possibly the name of the file and the line on which the symbol was declared. 
This symbol information is not stored in the module itself, because it takes up a lot of space.
