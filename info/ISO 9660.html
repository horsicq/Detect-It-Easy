ISO 9660 (also known as ECMA-119), also referred to as CDFS (Compact Disc File System)
 by some hardware and software providers[citation needed], is a file system standard
 published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for optical disc
 media. It aims at supporting different computer operating systems such as Windows,
 classic Mac OS, and Unix-like systems, so that data may be exchanged.
