Obsidium is a feature-rich professional software protection and licensing 
system that was designed as a cost effective and easy to implement, yet 
reliable and non-invasive way to protect your 32- and 64-bit Windows software 
applications and games from reverse engineering, unauthorized modifications (
"cracking") and redistribution ("software piracy") while providing a secure 
and flexible licensing/registration system.

It is primarily aimed at software companies and individual developers who 
would like to provide feature- or time-limited evaluation versions of their 
software products, but also allows for the implementation of a wide range 
of custom licensing scenarios.
