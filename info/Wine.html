Wine (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a compatibility 
layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating 
systems, such as Linux, Mac OSX, & BSD. Instead of simulating internal Windows 
logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into 
POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other 
methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.

Wine began in 1993 under the initial coordination of Bob Amstadt as a way to 
support running Windows 3.1 programs on Linux. Very early on, leadership over 
Wine's development passed to Alexandre Julliard, who has managed the project 
ever since. Over the years, as the Windows API and applications have evolved 
to take advantage of new hardware and software, Wine has adapted to support 
new features, all while being ported to other OSes, becoming more stable, 
and providing a better user-experience.

An ambitious project by definition, work on Wine would steadily continue 
for 15 years before the program finally reached v1.0, the first stable 
release, in 2008. Several releases later, Wine is still under active 
development today, and although there is more work to be done, millions 
of people are estimated to use Wine to run their Windows software on 
the OS of their choice.
