Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts 
in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C.
The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional 
programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management 
and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller,
Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. 
Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.
