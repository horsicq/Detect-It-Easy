Denuvo Anti-Tamper technology prevents the debugging, 
reverse engineering and changing of executable files to 
strengthen the security of games. It is not a DRM solution, 
but rather, Denuvo Anti-tamper protects DRM solutions, 
such as Origin Online Access or the Steam license management 
system, from being circumvented.
