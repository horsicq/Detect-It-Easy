Detecting files in Windows typically involves using programming languages like Python or PowerShell. Here's a general overview of how the process is done in Python using the `os` module:

1. Import the necessary modules:
```python
import os
```

2. Specify the directory where you want to search for files:
```python
directory_path = 'C:\\Your\\Directory\\Path'
```

3. Use the `os.listdir()` function to get a list of all files and directories in the specified directory:
```python
file_list = os.listdir(directory_path)
```

4. Loop through the list of files to filter and process them as needed. You can check file extensions, file names, or other attributes to detect specific files:
```python
for file_name in file_list:
    if file_name.endswith('.txt'):
        # Perform actions on .txt files, e.g., print the file name
        print(file_name)
```

This is a basic example of how to detect files in a Windows directory using Python. Depending on your specific requirements, you can add more complexity, such as recursive searching, filtering based on file attributes, or performing actions on the detected files.

If you prefer PowerShell, you can use cmdlets like `Get-ChildItem` to achieve similar results.
